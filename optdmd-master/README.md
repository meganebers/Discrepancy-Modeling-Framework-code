# optdmd 

A MATLAB package for computing the optimized DMD

## About

Information about the optimized DMD and this implementation
can be found in [this preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02343v1).
The source files contain documentation; for 
an interactive look at this documentation, open 
the index.html file from the docs folder in
a web browser.

## How to use

If you'd like to see how to use the OPTDMD wrappers
(for computing the optimized dynamic mode decomposition)
the best place to start is to check out simple_example.m
(in "examples" folder)
